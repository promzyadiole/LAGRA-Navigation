abstract: >
  LAGRA-Navigation is a ROS 2–based multimodal framework for autonomous robot
  navigation and interaction. The system integrates large language models (LLMs)
  and vision–language models (VLMs) with the ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2) stack to enable
  robots to interpret open-ended natural language commands, perceive their
  environment semantically, and execute navigation tasks in simulated environments.
